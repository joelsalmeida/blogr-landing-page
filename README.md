## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Javascript "learning and loving" :P
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets

### What I learned

In this project, I had the opportunity to fry some neurons working a little more with Javascript. It was really challenging and a lot of fun to find solutions for the different menus.

As this is a slightly larger project, it was interesting to separate some Sass files, it helped keep things tidier.

In this project I also had the opportunity to work with background image on pseudo-elements like "::after". Finding the correct way to add the links to the images was a bit tricky. "Living and learning" :P

I liked the final result... next time I'll do better!

### Continued development

Work with larger and more complex projects, especially with Javascript. I would also like to start studying something like the Bootstrap framework.
